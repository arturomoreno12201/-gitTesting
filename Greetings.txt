Hello my good sir,
I am afraid to inform you that we are unable to provide support to your ailing village at this time.
The society's funds have been drained by a recent purchase of fruit tarts and we are unable to spare any monetary relief at this time.
I do hope you understand our situation.

Best of luck in your future endevours,
Johann Tillsbury, Founder and President of the Society for Providing Relief to Villages Overrun by Wolves.
